# Lab4_Heroku

SVM based machine learning model hosted in heroku to predict the fish species based on length, height, width and weight.

The fish dataset is a record of 7 common different fish species in fish market sales. 
With this dataset, a predictive model is build using the SVM (Support Vector MAchines) machine learning algorithm data and the species of fish can be predicted.
